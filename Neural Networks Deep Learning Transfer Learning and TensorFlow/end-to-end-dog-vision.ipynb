    "# End-to-end Multi-class Dog Breed Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem\n",
    "Identifies the breed of a dog in an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I'm sitting at a cafe and I take a picture of a dog, I want to know what breed it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "The data were using is from the Kaggle Dog Breed Identification competition. https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation\n",
    "The evaluation is a file with prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each test image.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Features\n",
    "Some information about the data:\n",
    "* We're dealing with images (unstructured data) so it's probably best we use deep learning/transfer learning.\n",
    "* There are 120 breeds of dogs (this means there are 120 different classes).\n",
    "* There are around 10,000+ images in the training set (these images have labels).\n",
    "* There are around 10,000+ images in the test set (these images have no labels, because we'll want to predict them).\n"
